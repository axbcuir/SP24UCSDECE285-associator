Our project combines SAM and CLIP to effectively extract objects within cluttered, dynamic environments.

# Dataset
Our dataset is in mytable.zip. It contains two experiments. Each dataset has 10 images and features multiple objects: bottles of various colors and sizes, different types of objects. The arrangement of objects and lighting conditions vary between the two set

# Instruction
The work-flow of our model is in Project_Main.ipynb. In this file, you can set up your environment and test the model.

The functions of our model are all written in python file.
